		Given the need for inter-subject and inter-study comparability, spatial
		map registration to a standardized space is an indispensable part of
		Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Mouse MRI workflows commonly utilize
		high-level interfaces optimized for human data --- and adapt the data
		to the interface rather than vice-versa. Quality control (QC) is
		commonly performed by interactive operator inspection, making it
		infrequent, open to bias, slow, and unreproducible. In this paper we
		present a novel registration workflow accessible via both Bash and
		Python, which uses the full flexibility of low-level interfaces from
		one of the most popular normalization toolkits (ANTs). We provide an
		optimized set of parameters for mouse brain registration, and propose
		a standard space suited to harmonize mouse brain data across
		modalities. Additionally, we present QC workflows, which can
		automatically assess the registration quality of current as well as
		past processed datasets. With regard to both structural and functional
		considerations, we showcase the capabilities of this novel workflow
		compared to a legacy workflow (representative of common practices
		--- which we detail and comment).
